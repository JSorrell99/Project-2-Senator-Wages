# Minimum wage freeze: Senators prosper, minimum wage workers struggle

## Project Aim
This project aimed to analyze and visualize the growing disparity between U.S. Senators' salaries and the federal minimum wage over the past century. We sought to highlight the economic inequalities and spark discussion about fair compensation in America.

## Key Findings
- U.S. Senators currently earn more than 11 times the annual income of a full-time minimum wage worker.
- The federal minimum wage has remained unchanged at $7.25/hour since 2009, marking the longest period without an increase.
- When adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has struggled to keep pace with the cost of living, while Senators' salaries have seen substantial increases.
- Five states (Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee) do not have a state minimum wage, defaulting to the federal rate.

## Data Collection Process
- **U.S. Senators' Salary Data**: Collected from Senate.gov and Wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaries_of_members_of_the_United_States_Congress
- **Federal Minimum Wage Data**: Obtained from the U.S. Department of Labor
- **State Minimum Wage Data**: Gathered from the U.S. Department of Labor
- **Inflation Data**: Retrieved from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis
- **Data Scraping**: Scraped additional data from various sources using Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to ensure comprehensive and up-to-date information.

## Data Analysis Process
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data using Python and Pandas
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Used Python's pandas library to adjust historical wage data for inflation using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
- **Data Visualization**: Created interactive charts and maps using Datawrapper to illustrate wage disparities and state-by-state minimum wage differences.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated key metrics such as the wage ratio between Senators and minimum wage workers.

## New Skills and Growth Areas
- Developed proficiency in creating scrollytelling visualizations using Scrollama.js.
- Enhanced data visualization skills using Datawrapper for creating interactive maps and charts.
- Improved HTML and CSS skills for creating a responsive and visually appealing web page.
- Gained experience in data journalism techniques, combining data analysis with storytelling.

## Future Improvements (Skills/Time Permitting)
- Develop an interactive tool allowing users to input their state and job type to see personalized wage comparisons.
- Conduct a more in-depth analysis of the economic impact of minimum wage increases on different sectors.
- **Compare States at Minimum Wage or Lower to Poverty Levels and Education Levels**: Analyze how states with minimum wage laws (or lack thereof) correlate with poverty rates and education attainment levels. This would involve gathering data on poverty rates and education levels from sources such as the U.S. Census Bureau and Department of Education, then visualizing and statistically analyzing these relationships.
